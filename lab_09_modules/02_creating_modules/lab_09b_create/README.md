Lab Terraform Modules - Example 1

Example creating simple but complete modules
- vpc
- server instances

The goal of the module labs is to understand the relationships between the root module and the called modules, as well as the structure of a deployment with modules
- Where the modules are defined
    - What "input" parameters they expect 
    - What "outputs" they produce
- How they are called
    - How to pass parameters - required vs optional parameters
    - How to retrieve outputs from "inner" modules
